There are 2 copies included a .zip and .rar, both are the same but included due to some PCs not being able to open RARs by default,
there are also 2 builds of the tool, a 32bit and 64bit for compatibility reasons, if your not sure which one to use try 64bit first,
and if that won't work then try the other, in the case that both don't work then check the github page for fixes or updates.
